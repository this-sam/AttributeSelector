This is the software that I will use to prepare vectors of attributes
from chat conversations and write them to a file readable by various
data mining algorithms.

Notes:
	-All times are output in seconds, but all rates are measured in X/minutes
	-User object's selectFeatures function is built for the purpose of selecting
	 features both during initialization and afterwards by accepting a string of
	 attribute variable names.  A dictionary is returned mapping feature names to
	 values.
